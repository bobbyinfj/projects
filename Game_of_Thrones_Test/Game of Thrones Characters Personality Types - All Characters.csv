Beric Dondarrion,2,ENFJ,"“The night is dark and full of terrors.” That is your mantra. That is your clarion call. You are both a welcoming and galvanizing leader; your followers come from all stations in life, and find inspiration in your humble servitude to the Lord of Light. There is a vulnerability to your openness, and it makes people believe that you believe. Admittedly, it also helps that your blood can light a sword on fire, and that you keep coming back to life like some baddie in a slasher film.",http://youtopiaproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Beric.jpg,"""Death is the enemy.

The High Sparrow,2,ENFJ,"Despite the humble ambitions that you like to portray, you are not to be underestimated. Your most important trait is your sensitivity to the desires of your friends and followers. How else could you know that the moral decay and elitism of the Red Keep had left the populace seething with resentment? Your warning to all—past, present, and future, fiction and non-fiction—in the one percent: “You are the few, we are the many. And when the many stop fearing the few…”",http://youtopiaproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/HIgh-Sparrow-1024x682.jpg,"""You are the few. We are the many.""",5,,Polytheistic?,,
Mance Rayder,2,ENFJ,"With your charisma and diplomatic ability, you were the only person capable of uniting all of the warring factions beyond the Wall. Like your fellow Dolphins, you sought to understand all of the nuances of the individual clans, their different customs, languages, hierarchies, and in the end, convinced them that the ways they differed were far outweighed by the thing they shared: the need to survive.

Daenerys Targaryen,2,ENFP,"Your intuition led you into a bonfire that gave birth to three dragons, your moral conscience led to the liberation of Slaver’s Bay, and your confidence in your own strength lead to your unification of the entire Dothraki nation. You reveal your Baboon stripes in many ways—inspirational speeches, revolutionary goals—but none more revealing than your belief that you could climb onto the back of Drogon and, with no special training, become the first Dragon rider in more than a century.",http://youtopiaproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Daenerys-Targaryen-1024x576.jpg,"""A dragon is not a slave.""",11,,,,
Kinvara,2,ENFP,"The high priestess of the Lord of Light, you’re like the Pope... that is, if His Holiness had an army of soldiers and sorcerer priests at his disposal. Your voice is far-reaching and versatile. It can rally people across the entire continent of Essos to Daenerys’ cause, or silence the verbally pugnacious Lord Varys. Your true power, however, comes from the insight of your intuition, whether you get your visions from the flames or not.",http://youtopiaproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Kinvara-1024x619.jpg,"""Everyone is what they are and where they are for a reason.""",8,,,,
Rhaegar Targaryen,2,ENFP,"Charismatic, compassionate, wise, educated, skilled in both the martial and performing arts… oh c’mon! Really? Were you that perfect? It’s no small wonder why Baboons like you feel like they can do everything well—they often can. But like a true Baboon, you let your conflict between your passions—namely Lyanna Stark—and your doubts—whether you should overthrow your father, the psychotic Mad King—get you into trouble. You wanted to have it both ways: marry Lyanna and attain the throne peacefully. How’d that work out for ya?",http://youtopiaproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Rhaegar.png,"""Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly, and Rhaegar died.""",9,,,,
Olenna Tyrell,2,ENTJ,"You might play the part of the feeble old lady in public, but behind closed doors, you are a fearsome combatant that spars with all of the notable power players in King’s Landing. A born chess master, you know exactly how to best utilize your pieces: your ineffectual “king” of a son, your witless but brave “knight” of a grandson, and your granddaughter Margaery, your figurative and literal queen. Blunt in conversation and domineering in presence, you’ve fully earned your title as the Queen of Thorns.",http://youtopiaproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/olenna-tyrell-1024x576.jpg,"""I wonder if you're the worst person I've ever met.

Tywin Lannister,2,ENTJ,"The most powerful person in Westeros, your status as ultimate field marshal and strategist is unrivaled. Foresight even has a part to play in your obsession with achievement—what else is an accomplished person’s “legacy” but the ripples felt from their impact, a shockwave felt beyond their death and into future centuries? Of course, it can also mean the children we leave behind. In your case, one respects you, one hates you, and another one shot you in the heart with a crossbow.

Xaro Xhoan Daxos,2,ENTJ,"Whoa, you mean the guy all the way from season 2? Yep, that was you who got locked up quite unceremoniously. However, before that moment of defeat, you had risen up from simple dockworker to the richest man in Qarth. You’re ambitious and industrious, unafraid to make bold moves, like vouching for Daenerys so that you might later steal her dragons. I know it all probably feels like empty praise as you waste away in that vault, but at least you’re sharing death with that hot girl from Lys that had even the Mother of Dragons getting all bi-curious.

Euron Greyjoy,2,ENTP,"Playful and coy in public, seemingly impulsive in behavior, it’s hard to know exactly what you’re thinking. Your psychotic, almost delusional shtick comes in handy when proving to people that you are the most dangerous pirate alive. Little do they know of the depths of your cunning. Little do they fear your talent for long-term manipulation. I’d say you were “crazy like a fox”, but that wouldn’t do you justice. You’re a Chimpanzee. Foxes do what they think others will want.

Qyburn,2,ENTP,"Drs. Mengele and Frankenstein have nothing on you, the mad scientist of Westeros. Some might call your experiments reckless. Some might call them unethical. And yet, those same people are the ones who came begging for a secret weapon to counter the dragons. They’re the same people who benefit from your boldness in the healing arts.

Tyrion Lannister,2,ENTP,"The possessor of a keen and innovative mind, you can use it to prevent the slaughter of a city from within and without, counsel a Queen on the best way to conquer a continent, or, in a pinch, convince slavers not to cut your dick off. And for those who are intelligent enough to see past your jesting, they know that the drunken dwarf, who is never at a loss for a wisecrack or an ironic jibe, is an intellectual force to be reckoned with.",http://youtopiaproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/tyron-lannister.jpg,"""That's what I do: I drink and I know things.""",11,"fetishes?

Catelyn Stark,2,ESFJ,"Lead den mother and family-first extraordinaire, you took Littlefinger’s bait and kidnapped Tyrion Lannister, instigating the war between the Starks and the Lannisters. Of course, considering how much you care about family, and how it was a pseudo-brother and real sister that betrayed you, we really can’t blame you. You would do anything for your family, even releasing the despicable Jaime Lannister. And you’re constantly welcoming new members (Brienne), so long as you don’t believe that they’re your husband’s love child with another woman (Jon).",http://youtopiaproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Catelyn.png,"""Show them how it feels to lose what they love.""",6,,,,
Hot Pie,2,ESFJ,"Guess what? You’re our favorite culinary traveling companion. With a discerning nose for sausages and a baking virtuosity that’s tragically underrated, you’re the Nancy Silverton of Westeros. All you want to do is provide for those that you care about and stay out of wars that, by their very definition, invite conflict. If only people would learn to get along, shoot a little Michelin star attention your way and, most importantly, understand that they CANNOT GIVE UP ON THE GRAVY.",http://youtopiaproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Hot-Pie.jpg,"""Friends don't pay.""",8,,,,
Mace Tyrell,2,ESFJ,"I know what you’re thinking. “Really, I’m Mace fuckin’ Tyrell?” Not the brightest star in a sky of gleaming characters. At least Mace really leans into that designation, as he is <i>literally</i> not very bright. And yet, you are the most powerful lord in the Reach, a region with the largest army, most plentiful agricultural resources, and location of the Citadel, Westeros’ version of the Ivy League, in all its ivory tower splendor.

Sansa Stark,2,ESFJ,"Socially aware and possessed with a proclivity to withstand pain as opposed to give it, you needed both of those traits to survive your time as future Queen of the Andals and fiancé to Joffrey, otherwise known as the unluckiest person in Westeros. It says a lot about the nature of an Elephant that despite your various tragedies, you’re still basically the same optimistic, friendly person, albeit with a toughness strengthened by experience and a skepticism sharpened by Littlefinger.

Robert Baratheon,2,ESFP,"How fitting that Storm’s End is your ancestral home—your loud, brash personality brings the storm wherever you go. Some Guardians might describe your behavior as gluttonous, but for a Peacock like yourself, there’s no apologizing for having a lust for life. Big in every sense of the word, the special skills section of your curriculum vitae reads: experienced alcohol tolerance, battlefield and bedroom stamina, bear hug master, smashed Rhaegar Targaryen to pieces with trusted war hammer.",http://youtopiaproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Robert.jpg,"""All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls.""",11,I like em: All of em,Goldilocks: Just right,,
Theon Greyjoy,2,ESFP,"An attention whore if there ever was one, you know full well the danger that fame holds when it twists to infamy. Whatever.

Tormund Giantsbane,2,ESFP,"King Robert can have his bear hugs; you’ve actually slept with an actual she-bear! Or so you say… though, in fairness, you usually back up all of your big talk with big action.

Cersei Lannister,2,ESTJ,"The authority of your title, the prestige of your family—does anyone ever really refer to you as a Baratheon?—these are the foundations on which you seek to rule over all of Westeros. Your strength is without question, and to those that do question, your answer is almost always death.

Gendry,2,ESTJ,"You possess a natural strength and willingness to serve and protect—not that Arya needed it. You also have a toughness hardened by years of toil in the forge of life, and much like a smith, you usually accomplish your goals by banging on them hard enough until they bend to your will. That being said, as a Stag, you accept that there are forces in nature and man-made institutions greater than yourself, and you obediently and humbly comply to their authority, whether you are in command or are being commanded.",http://youtopiaproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Gendry.jpg,"""All that about cocks, I should never have said it.""",,What's worse?

Daario Naharis,2,ESTP,You’re a lover. You’re a fighter. You’re a charming cad that knows exactly what a person wants to hear and exactly how you should appear.

Jaime Lannister,2,ESTP,"Brash, cocky, and with a mouth that can get you in and out of trouble, you are the prototypical Fox charmer. One could imagine your life as a perpetual bed-hopper if you weren’t in love with your sister. Of course, like all rogues, your confidence comes with a comeuppance-leads-to-humility-leads-to-true strength arc as clockwork as a Tom Cruise movie—just thank your preternaturally lucky stars that, for most Foxes, this humbling comes without the loss of an actual hand.",http://youtopiaproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Jaime-Lannister.png,"""By what right does the wolf judge the lion?""",11,"Left or right handed?

Your story shows how altruism can flow through all types, not only via the Idealists, as some of them believe.

But, as a Panda, that will often be your legacy: to be remembered, respected, and revered by the many men and women you mentored.

Jon Snow,2,INFJ,"Facing that common Panda conundrum—wanting to be accepted in a society that leaves you marginalized—you, the Bastard of Winterfell, sought out greater purpose with the egalitarian Night’s Watch.

Maybe you’re someone who lives off the grid. Maybe you’re that person who is secretly planning the downfall of Monsanto. Whatever your cup of crazy, like Melisandre, you have deeply held beliefs that you adhere to in an almost militant fashion. Maybe that’s why your tutelage is sought after.

"Bran Stark, the Three-eyed Raven",2,INFP,"Like most Humpback Whales, you’re extremely sensitive and thoughtful—or what a pessimist would call hypersensitive—and sometimes these predominant traits can cause you to detach yourself from the concrete world.

While other characters squabble for political gain or flee south, you led your party north towards certain danger, all so that you might discover your true identity.",http://youtopiaproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Bran-Stark.png,"""Because our way is the old way.""",11,Worse way to die? ,,,

Like your protégé, Bran Stark, you are a greenseer—a person who can perceive past, present, and future with ease. You reveal very little information about yourself, though, typical for a Humpback Whale, it’s clear to any observant person that there’s a wealth of personality beyond your pensive gaze.",http://youtopiaproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/three-eyed-raven.jpg,"""You will never walk again, but you will fly.""",4,Worse way to die?

But I think many would agree that no death was more heartbreaking—and none more unnecessary—than the sacrificial burning of noble Shireen. Most of your life was spent in the dream world of your books, cultivating a vivid imagination and empathic intelligence befitting a Humpback Whale. And just like the Baratheon Princess, your starry-eyed optimism is often misinterpreted as weakness.

Tycho Nestoris,2,INTJ,"Dry, controlled, and skeptical of actions motivated by emotion, you are as cold as the water that separates Westeros from your homeland of Braavos. Numbers. Facts. These are things that a rational person such as yourself can feel comfortable working with, as they exist without the danger of misinterpretation. It’s not to say that you’re devoid of feelings. You just prefer to compartmentalize, and in your mind, objectivity deserves to hang front and center, and passion belongs tucked away in the sock drawer.

Doran Martell,2,INTJ,"If you only read the books, you’d be thinking, “hell yeah, Doran is the shit”. Unfortunately, we’re using the show as reference, which means all of the strategy, intelligence, and patience of the proud Prince of Dorne is replaced by a knife coup de grace he should’ve seen coming, delivered by someone who probably views Ariana Grande as an older, more mature role model.

Littlefinger,2,INTJ,"Impenetrable to all save a select few, you are the calculating Lord Peytr Baelish. You like to play your cards close to your vest, which serves to hide your Spider’s web of schemes (within schemes (within schemes)) from view.

Like a typical Owl, you possess a wealth of knowledge, and a depth of clear-eyed counsel that proves invaluable to the young, insecure Jon Snow.

Davos Seaworth,2,ISFP,"Easy-going and understated, you live for the simple pleasures in life, like bonding with precocious Shireen Baratheon. A gentle soul that prefers woodcarving to bloodshed, you can’t understand the violent zealotry that Melisandre preaches. For you, the best day is a day spent feeling the wind on your face as you sail along the coast, while sneaking in the occasional smuggling run to remind you that you’re still alive.",http://youtopiaproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Davos-Seaworth.jpg,"""If you're a famous smuggler you're not doing it right.""",11,Would you rather be born in to a good life?,,,
Missandei,2,ISFP,"Your polite and quiet demeanor hides the magma-like current of emotions smoldering just beneath the surface. Your sensitivity to everything can make you a bit of a crier. It can also make you into a bit of a superhero when it comes to the sensory arts. But these talents you possess rarely manifest into boastfulness; much like your support for your beloved Daenerys, they’re performed with very little fanfare. For Butterflies like yourself, the beauty of the action is pleasurable enough.",http://youtopiaproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/missandei.jpg,"""I have tried wine before. It made me feel funny.""",7,Would you rather be born in to a good life?,,,
Loras Tyrell,2,ISFP,"“Knight of the Flowers”, I know, not a particularly intimidating moniker, but it does perfectly describe the dual nature of your Butterfly grace: it can be used to produce beauty or kick some serious ass. You’re gentle by nature—your best fighting is displayed during the pageantry of tournaments—and most of your time is spent vacillating between fighting for those you love (Renly) and letting those that love you (Margaery) fight your battles.

Jaqen H'ghar,2,ISFP,"“Dying is an art and I do it well. I do it so it feels like Hell”. You took Sylvia Plath’s words to heart and decided to take a more active role in the craft. For you, there is a beauty in everything, even Death. Soft-spoken to the point barely above a whisper, you tend to let your actions do the talking. But unlike the more aggressive Sharks, you derive excitement not from the adrenaline of the kill, but the greater art it serves.",http://youtopiaproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/jaqen.jpg,"""All men must serve. Faceless men most of all.""",,,,,
Grey Worm,2,ISTJ,"What do you call the toughest warrior of the toughest army with the toughest backstory? So what if you’re not the greatest joke-teller, or that you don’t like to drink unless commanded to? You’ve experienced some of the worst that humanity has to offer and, not only survived to not tell the tale, but are currently kicking the worst’s ass. A true Beaver, you prefer to do your duty without the attention that gaudier types might seek. I would call you a humble survivor, but even that might be too much gilding the lily for you.",http://youtopiaproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Grey-worm-1024x658.png,"""Games are for children.""",,Do you have a penis?,,,
Jorah Mormont,2,ISTJ,"It must be that raspy, seasoned growl when you say “Khaleesi” that informs us of your world-weary perspective on life. Most of us haven’t had our wife leave us for a richer man, or betrayed the honor of our father, or spied on a benefactor for a pardon. And to your credit, despite your flaws—which you’ve long accepted while other types readily ignore their own—you find a way to use your cautious, practical approach to serve a greater cause. Without your tremendous discipline and counsel, Daenerys might still be stranded in Essos.",http://youtopiaproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/jorah.jpg,"""The common people... don't care what games the high lords play.""",9,,,,
Lysa Arryn,2,ISTJ,"Even after marriage you found a way to stay true to your Tully roots of “Family, Duty, Honor”. That said, you did help start a war that led to the death of thousands, including your older sister and uncle, but no one’s perfect. And if anyone might question your objectivity, leadership, or parenting—you were totally in on questionable breastfeeding before it was a thing—remind them that you willingly freed Tyrion Lannister after his victorious trial, preserved the lives of the Vale soldiers during the War of Five Kings, and…your son Robin? He’s still alive. ",http://youtopiaproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/lysa-1024x576.jpeg,"""Marriage changes people.""",1,,,,
Stannis Baratheon,2,ISTJ,"To say that you adhere to the rules would be an understatement. You’re merciless in your measured manners and fierce in your fairness, even to yourself; how else can we explain your willingness to sacrifice your own daughter for the sake of duty? There is a certain twisted glory—a word that is probably anathema to you—in shunning the deepest desires of one’s own heart for the burden of responsibility. It is a thankless display of bravery, and it is that modifier that makes all the difference.",http://youtopiaproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/stannis-baratheon-1024x576.jpg,"""Hard truths cut both ways.""",11,,,,
Arya Stark,2,ISTP,"Attack first, ask questions—maybe never. As fierce as your wolf Nymeria, and with an obsessive attachment to your favorite tool, Needle, you’re a role model for all Sharks who have a list of names. Fear is not something you like to admit, but even when you are afraid, you tend to deal with it head-on. Some people might think you’re too mean. Others might think you’re too aggressive. But those people can go fuck themselves.",http://youtopiaproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/arya-stark.png,"""Nothing is just nothing.""",11,Cat or Dog person? love'em both,,,
Bronn,2,ISTP,"You’re a precise kind of mercenary; thanks to your top-notch hand-eye coordination, you make working with tools seem natural. Maybe that’s why you like to keep your hands clean, even though it always seems like you’re doing something “dirty” with them. Friends like your flexible view of the world; it’s a perspective that enables you to never run low on witty one-liners that cut as sharply as the knives you wield with deft proficiency.",http://youtopiaproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bronn.jpeg,"""There's no cure for being a cunt.""",10,,,,
The Hound,2,ISTP,"With you, blunt and candid as you are, no one ever has to worry about any miscommunication. You tell it like it is, and if people have a problem with that, well, you usually kill them. Not to say that you’re a man or woman without morals. It’s that unlike other more loquacious types (AKA talkers who are full of shit and make you thirsty), you prefer to let your actions fight for what you believe.",http://youtopiaproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/the-hound.jpg,"""Dead rats don't squeak.""",9,Cat or Dog person?

Anyone thinking about giving you shit be warned: there’s a high probability that said shit shall be returned with either a kick in the groin or an arrow expertly shot in their ass… or both. For a Shark like you, people decisions are often easy: protect the ones you love, destroy the ones you hate, and sleep with the ones who fall into both categories.",http://youtopiaproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Ygritte.jpg,"""You know nothing, Jon Snow.""",8,,,,
